As of today, the celebration of Finno-Ugric Day has grown into an almost month-long festival that takes place all across Estonia and includes an international conference, concerts, exhibitions, lectures, and a rich film program. Fenno-Ugria is the main organiser of these events, but an impressive number of museums, educational institutions, cultural organizations, and civil associations all across Estonia likewise join in. One of the festival’s most awaited events are its large folk concerts played by bands and musicians representing almost every living Finno-Ugric nation, thus giving diverse audiences a clearer picture of their kindred peoples’ unique folklore. Jazz and ethno-rock artists are also popular on the concert lineups, as is folk-inspired chamber music.
 
Finno-Ugric Days events are held simultaneously in Finland, Hungary, and the Finno-Ugric regions of Russia and Latvia.

  CHILDREN AND YOUTH ""GOLDEN FISH""
 A celebration of Tulcea - a global celebration, a celebration of traditions around the world
1993 – 2015

Many years ago in 1992 based on the idea of  Mr. Prof. Stefan Coman, choreographer and coordinator of children's folk ensemble ""Doruletul"" Palace of Children and Students from Tulcea, to create a true celebration of folk everywhere and Danube to gather the messengers of folklore all children in the country and abroad, founded one of the largest international folk festivals for children and youth in the country.
 	Since the first edition (the 1993) Tulcea festival was attended by seven foreign folk (Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, Albania, Georgia, Russia, Moldova) and ten sets representing different counties (Alba Bacau , Braila, Constanta, Gorj, Olt, Timis Nasaud, Suceava, and Prahova Salaj). These folk have added the Tulcea County (Isaccea Cercheza glory, Niculitel, springs, Greece, Children's Palace Tulcea).
 	Organized by Student Club Tulcea, Tulcea County School Inspectorate and financed by the Ministry of Education and financially supported by many companies, the first festival proved a success in a gathering tulcenii overwhelmingly. From the first moment of the festival artistic folk costumes parade the streets have become overcrowded, and later show room to be besieged by curious of all ages.
 	Since the 1995 Festival International Festivals calendar is included in the annual published by the International Council of Folklore Festivals Organization (CIOFF) Section B of UNESCO.
 	The large number of people forced virtually the organizers for the coming years to hold outdoor performances outside competition.
 	In 1995 the festival has hosted over 1,000 participants came from ten countries and 15 counties in Romania, financed by the Ministry of National Education in the percentage of 48% remaining costs being provided by sponsors - companies in Tulcea County.
 	The fifth edition of International Festival ""Golden Fish"" is already a tradition and a quality standard of national and international folklore.
 	Since 1997 the festival budget has contributed and Tulcea County Council (6.5%) the remaining budget being provided by the Ministry of Education (52.4%) and sponsors (41.1%). In 1998 he joined the Ministry of Culture (11.2%) of a total budget of 355 million (ROL), and in 1999 became co-financing and Artistic Ensemble ""Delta Ballads"" so far.
 	Eighth edition was attended by ten ensembles and 14 foreign counties.
 	Co-funder of the International Folklore Festival for Children and Youth ""Golden Fish"" since 2004 and became Tulcea Municipality, which in recent years has provided the largest co-financing.
 	The large number of folk who have requested participation (in each year of implementation) allowed to carry out rigorous selections are accepted only those with high artistic. This festival has not lost its attraction, continued to increase the number of shows held by the young participants.
 	Due to this festival, they performed on the stages Tulcea ensembles from all over the world, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Poland, Macedonia, Hungary, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Venezuela, Italy, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, Croatia, Lithuania, Latvia, Cyprus, Netherlands, etc. Romanian and assemblies in all provinces of the country.
 	The festival was held every year Tulcea County School Inspectorate, Children and Pupils Palace Tulcea, and in 1999 came along and Artistic Center Tulcea County because Mr. Stephen Coman was appointed director of this institution, but he remained a professor at the Department of Student Club Folk Assembly, being the festival director and Artistic Ensemble ""Delta Ballads"" and now the main sponsor became  Tulcea Municipality.
 	Every edition of the festival was organized as a contest on two sections: Romanian and foreign.
 	The jury was composed of specialists in every field (dance, ethnology, music), names of  Radio, TV, cultural institutions, etc.. Examples: Tita Sever, Gheorghe Popescu, Nicolae Nistor, Theodor Vasilescu, Marin Barbu, Eugenia Florea, Florentina Satmari etc.
 	The festival was presented every year in local and national media and is considered the greatest festival in Romania and abroad and has gained a worldwide reputation in the organization and quality.
 	However, this festival remains an essential component of the public.
 	At a time when discussing the issue of globalization, European identity and its relation to national identities one of the problems of mass communication systems is the ability to survive the media in a society, over some periods of time. In a democratic society, the government has a limited role, stability and survival communication systems are more difficult to identify, and a very important place is occupied by the local community.
 	In the current Tulcea Festival ""Golden Fish"" passed from one generation to another group or cultural heritage of the nation, its ideology: a vision of past, present and future world. This is a mixture of myths, traditions, values and principles which give individuals an ethnic or national identity, helps him discover and integrate.
 	This year 2012 the festival celebrates the twentieth edition number - Jubilee Edition.

438,SILISTRA MUNICIPALITY 33 SIMEON VELIKI STR.,SILISTRA International Children's Dance Festival 'Tomorrow's Peace begins with today's friendship',kultura_ss@abv.bg,"","",28,true,false,"DESCRIPTION
Every year Silistra is the festival center of a prestigious event - the International Children's Dance Festival ""Tomorrow's Peace begins with today's friendship"".
This is a celebration of sunny children's smiles, the bright color of costumes from different corners of the world, the only language spoken worldwide - the language of music and dance. 
The festival is organized by the Municipality of Silistra. It is held under the patronage of the Mayor of the Municipality of Silistra and with the support of the Ministry of Culture.
It started in 1994, as the first International Children's Dance Festival in Bulgaria with the impactive message: ""Tomorrow's peace begins with today's friendship.""
Many children's dance groups from all over the world - Europe, Asia, America, Africa, have visited Silistra. The history of the festival is extremely rich and preserves original culture, dance and music. Thousands of young participants, viewers and guests get to keep the love of the dance in their hearts for a lifetime, as well as the memory of friendship and the hospitality of the beautiful city of Silistra. 
The citizens of Silistra warmly welcome the youngest ambassadors of today's friendship and tomorrow's peace. Every participant, guest and spectator enjoys watching the smiling and beautiful children's faces, beautiful dances and costumes.     
The contribution of the festival to the dialogue between young people, cultures and peoples is invaluable. 
Every year more than 500 children from 4-5 countries and 10 local dance formations are included in the event.
During the event there is a festival club in the foyer of the Hall of the Municipality of Silistra, where journalists, participants, guests and citizens can get updated information about the festival days. For three consecutive evenings, the audience in Silistra witnesses extremely rich and colorful concerts, presented to us by the ""Children of the World"". 
Accompanying events during the festival are:
- The beginning of the festival - a great parade through the city, featuring all children's groups, guests and hosts of the festival. 
- ""Dance Workshop"" - learning one of the most popular dances from each country, guest at the festival. All children participating in the festival also take part in the workshop. The workshop is held outdoors - in the Danube Park. 
- Miss and Mister Festival competition. A celebration of friendship and love, a message for tomorrow's peace. Children write their messages for peace on a piece of paper. 
- The official closing of the festival is accompanied by a Final Festival concert with the participation of all groups. All participants dance together to show the dances they learned at the workshop and finish with “horo”. Paper letters with messages for peace are released to fly in the sky, hung on balloons so they can symbolically reach the whole world. 
During these festival days, new friendships are being created, and the slogan of the international children's forum ""Tomorrow’s peace starts with today’s friendship"" is proved in practice.

St. Stephen, founder of the Hungarian State, made the month of August a month of celebration as a tribute to Christianity. Although after his death and later canonization the religious celebrations continued, the festivity shortly became the celebration of St. Stephen himself.

The “Golden Charter” in 1222 –Europe’s second constitution – reinforced the importance of the occasion making it into a national holiday, St. Stephen’s memorial day. Thanks to Royal Days, Alba Regia (the latin name for Székesfehérvár) became the governmental centre of the Hungary.

Back in the old days, around 20th August the king visited Székesfehérvár, and during his visit held a reception learning about the matters of state. During his visit St. Stephen’s memorial day was also celebrated.

The former coronation town remembers its past through dance and music, while ensembles arriving from many countries around the world present their folk dances and music.

Over the following years, MonteVerde continues to organize this event and brings to Madeira Island a wide variety of national and international folklore groups, from Spain, Italy, Slovenia, Slovakia, Russia, Colombia, Paraguay, Croatia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Mexico, Poland, France, Estonia and Latvia.
On January 15, 2015, the MonteVerde Folklore Group joins CIOFF and in 2017 begins the evaluation process for the International Gala of Ethnography and Folklore Manuel Ferreira Pio to be considered an effective festival of this institution.
2018 is a turning point, as the International Folklore Festival is renamed “Funchal Folk - Arraial do Mundo”. “Arraial do Mundo” aims to reconcile a very expressive expression of ours, reminiscent of the ancient pilgrimages to Our Lady of Monte made by pilgrims from various parishes in Madeira, all moved by the faith and revelry inherited from the primitive settlers. Thus, it was our intention to apply this concept to “Funchal Folk”, as if it were a gathering of the World, with the participation of several countries, with their cultural traits and very peculiar experiences that, in this way, come together in an authentic gathering of party, culture, traditions and human exchange - this on a more global scale.
In 2019, the festival obtains its third and last positive evaluation, thus becoming the 12th CIOFF Festival nationwide and the first one held in Madeira Island.

?  Les droits culturels des communautés culturelles vivant en Suisse sont-ils inclus dans la Convention de l’UNESCO 2003 pour la sauvegarde de leur patrimoine immatériel ?

?  La Suisse contribue-t-elle à la sauvegarde des traditions vivantes de ces communautés culturelles dans notre pays ?

The international folklore festival Takí sme (This is us) is specific and unique in the
Nitra region. It is one of the festivals in Slovakia, which is organized under the
auspices and with status of CIOFF, which guarantees its high artistic level and
organizational quality.
Since 2016, the main partner of the event has been the Slovak Arts Council. Since
2008, the main organiser has been the Regional Education Centre in Levice
(hereinafter referred to as ROS). The director of the festival is Alžbeta Sádovská
and the programme director is David Hudec, ROS methodologist.
We firmly believe that culture is extremely important at regional level. It is one of
the most important pillars of our lives. It is in regional culture that we can see our
strength. Continuous efforts to improve the quality of the programme offer, an
increasing number of interesting and stimulating side events for all ages are
paying off in the increasing attendance at the festival. High-quality organization
and staffing, and extensive promotion contribute to the stability and improvement
of the festival and, consequently, to increasing public awareness of its importance
and value. Each year we try to organise the festival in a different village or town of
our district. Our intention and goal is to bring traditional folk culture to the
awareness of all inhabitants of our region, to deepen international relations and
friendship, to spread awareness of the regions of Tekov and Hont. However, the
most important and significant role of the festival is that it connects cultures,
nationalities, minorities and different countries of Europe.

Co-organizers of the festival are villages and towns of our district: (14/9), Levice,
and other in the process of solving where the festival takes place during the
five days of the event. Without the willing and professional cooperation of villages
and towns, an event of such a dimension as the festival Takí sme (This is us)
undoubtedly is, could not be organized.

During the five days there will be four galas, two educational concerts and dance
houses, one folk costume parade, a show of gastronomic specialties (“párance”,
strudels, “podplamenník”), a traditional fair of folk craftsmen, expositions and
lectures. We will also take care of the little ones - dancing, creative workshops....
For cooperation and support in the preparation and realization of the festival we
would like to thank the Slovak Arts Council, the Town of Levice, the Tekov Museum
in Levice and the Nitra Self-Governing Region.

we are looking forward to you

It was one of the first ones on the soil of today's Slovenia, and in the area of Yugoslavia at the time. In the years since its inception, it has developed into a unique four-day event that serves originality above all: with music whose popularity cannot be disputed, with dance that is still based on tradition and an offer of homeliness that makes visitors love to return to the shelter of the mighty oaks in the castle of Beltinci Park.

The festival's annual motto is still SONG AND DANCE UNITE NATIONS. According to experts in the field of folklore, it is one of the few events that has preserved its identity and has not succumbed to the trend of commercialization. Due to the familiarity, the warm welcome and the large audience, the festival also presents visiting groups with an unforgettable experience. The association has been organizing it since its foundation in 1969. It grew out of the activities of the FOLKLORE GROUP, which has been operating for more than 85 years and received the EUROPEAN AWARD FOR ORIGINALITY in 1985. At the same time, the group is the recipient of MAROLT'S PLAQUE and - the dancers are particularly proud of this - the KUD Beltinci Folklore Group was awarded years ago by the President of the Republic of Slovenia, dr. Danilo Türk, with the ORDER OF MERIT.

Throughout the years of the festival, visitors could learn about the cultural wealth of many nations from more than 30 countries, including all regions in Slovenia. We are also happy that around 10,000 visitors see the festival every year, who can enjoy dance, songs, folk jokes and customs, as well as cuisine, from Thursday to Sunday.

We want it to stay that way, so we always try to provide visitors with the highest quality and most varied program.","",offline,Kulturno umetniško društvo Beltinci,"","","","","","","","1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0",2024-09-05 07:28:45.881,,1

Shortly after the foundation back in 1956, folk art group Die Spelewei vzw organized the first local harvest festival. This event was soon getting bigger and it became the Internationaal Folklorefestival of Westerlo. As such, it is one of the oldest folk dance festivals of Belgium.

In front of the late-19th century castle, the festival is organized every year midst August. Five amateur folk art groups from all over the world take part in this festival to show their culture through traditional dances and music.

Participating dancers and musicians stay in host families. The families became very special for the festival because their hospitality is praised by the participating groups over and over again. In return, these families have a wonderful time with their guests during six days. The visiting groups get a unique chance to experience the Flemish way of life. That is why the folklore festival of Westerlo always is an event never to be forgotten by the participating groups and host families.

Internationaal Folklorefestival Westerlo is a member of CIOFF. This memberships can be seen as quality labels for our festival.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the international folklore festival “Baltica” cannot be held as usual – as a live event, therefore, the organizers have chosen a different implementation form for it. 
On 20–22 September, in celebration of the Equinox Day and the Baltic Unity Day, there will be held an online or, if the situation allows, semi-online forum “Baltica-Web 2021”, dedicated to a deeper dive into the traditional cultural phenomena, the historical and the cultural interrelations of the three Baltic countries – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which are the organizers of the festival “Baltica”. The forum program will be of two parts – theoretical and artistic, which includes lectures, illustrated presentations, discussions, folklore concerts, music project “Ancestral Weaves” (Lith. “Proteviu audos”), traditional dance event “All “Baltica” dance”, demonstrations of crafts, and traditional ceremonial cuisine, and other interesting activities.
The theme of the forum remains the same as it was assigned to the 2020 festival “Baltica” – the ritual. It will unfold both in the theoretical and in the artistic parts of the programme: by discussing and demonstrating musical (vocal and instrumental) and choreographic folklore, as well as customs, gastronomic and other kinds of heritage, by highlighting archaic and ceremonial forms, by sharing the good safeguarding practices concerning the old traditions. 
Every country is preparing their programme not only following the proposed topics, but also in their mother language in order to show and emphasize the uniqueness and national identity of the Baltic languages, therefore, presentations, lectures and discussions will be simultaneously translated into all three languages.
The events will be broadcast online from the special studios in all three countries. If, the conditions allow, part of the activities will be live.

This huge event is always organised in the middle of the summer. During nine days folklore lovers can participate in outdoor concerts of regional Polish and foreign groups in five towns (Wisla, Szczyrk, Zywiec, Maków Podhalanski, Oswiecim). Additionally, there are going to be organised local folk events in four other locations (Ujsoly, Jablonków, Istebna, Bielsko-Biala) and processions in order to attract people and encourage them to come to amphitheatres – colourful costumes, joyous folk songs, and even dance performances seduce inhabitants and tourists. The atmosphere is always unique. One of the most important events organised since 1970 during the Beskidy Highlanders’ Week of Culture is the Festival of Polish Highlanders’ Folklore competition, which presents the beauty and variety of the Polish highlanders’ culture. It is particularly exciting for the participants. Every group wants to win the first prize, which is the Zywiec Gold Heart. The exotic and the unknown are usually the most interesting for the viewers. Therefore the foreign groups are the attraction too. They appear on all the festival stages, but they mainly participate in International Folk Meetings. It has been organised since 1990, alternately in Wisla and Zywiec. The performers are appraised by the International Art Council, which is composed of distinguished specialists, ethnomusicologists, and ethnographers. One person is not able to see and experience everything, but it is the best idea to choose one place and be there for a couple of evenings in a row. The tickets are not necessary because the shows are free. On some occasions, it is worth coming a little bit earlier in order to find a good seat. Before the concerts start, the whole audience sings the unofficial anthem of the Beskidy highlanders “Szumi jawor”, which was written by Adam Niedoba. We cordially invite you to our festival!

The ensembles’ programmes should be adjusted to the child’s age and interpretive skills, and their foundations should be children’s games and play characteristic of a given region. The Festival participants: Polish and foreign ensembles (up to 14 years) are paired up to form comrade couples who perform together at concerts and during attendant events. This allows the children to get to know each other better during everyday Festival life and to forge closer rapport. Each comrade couple has its “national day.” On that day during the main concert the ensembles initiate shared fun with the audience, as well as they have an opportunity to present the culture of their own country and region in various forms of off-stage activity (national cuisine, exhibitions, fairs). During the final concert all the ensembles perform a joint stage programme following one specific idea. Such a concert formula makes it possible to make the children realise that cultural differences are no barrier to the achievement of common goals and creation of new values. During the Festival week there is also a number of attendant events, providing the participants with the possibility of relaxation and fun, as well as allowing the children to see the beauty of southern Poland. The Artistic Committee is in session during the Festival. In meetings with ensemble leaders it evaluates the programmes and stage performance.

C'est le groupe roumain NEDEIA de NOVACI qui a été le premier à « ouvrir le bal »... dans le gymnase de la ville sur une scène en bois devant 100 spectateurs !

Devant l'engouement des débuts, la formule a rapidement évoluée, vers un mini-festival en 1996, avec la participation de six pays sur trois jours.

En 1999, le Festival pris son rythme de croisière avec la présence de neuf ensembles folkloriques sur six jours.

Au fil des années, le festival a acquis une grande notoriété qui dépasse aujourd'hui largement le cadre régional avec près de 35 000 festivaliers venant essentiellement de l'Est de la France.

Ce succès, on le doit à la présence indéfectible de plus de 150 bénévoles qui s'impliquent depuis de nombreuses années dans l'organisation générale et à tous les niveaux : accueil des groupes, restauration, spectacles, buvettes, activités sportives et culturelles...

Fidèle à des valeurs de tolérances, de partage, d'amitié et de paix entre les peuples, le festival est devenu un véritable carrefour des peuples qui permet la découverte des cultures du monde.

Une découverte accessible au plus grand nombre puisque depuis 2012, les organisateurs ont engagé un pari audacieux : l'accès gratuit à tous les spectacles !

Depuis 2014, le Festival se délocalise avec l'organisation de nombreux spectacles sur le territoire de la nouvelle Communauté de Communes Terres de Saône qui regroupe 38 communes.

Today's demonstration, resumed in 2007 after several years of suspension, is becoming increasingly important over the years, for our municipality and for those towns layed along the hills of the region, and the population looks forward to the presentation of the program every year, and above all waits to know the groups that the ‘Balarins’ will go to present. The groups, taking part into this event, are not part of any circuit, and are guests of the city of Buja and only here they perform to the public. This is acharacteristic of this event, which wants to be first of all a moment of encounter and exchange of European cultures of different character, meeting of people and interweaving of friendship relations between groups and people, not only showing the public music and dances from every part of Europe, but creating bridges and dialogues between people of culture, thought, religion, principles different from each other: this spirit of personal friendship pervades the evenings of the festival.
The cooperation with Cioff ® Italia gave us new possibilities for welcoming groups from various areas of Europe.
We want this occasion to become a central point of our activity, we want to bring to Buja from year to year, the groups known in the tours around Europe, which with us have had and have special cooperation and friendship relationships. We want to bring musicality and cultural experiences from all over Europe to Buja, making known uses, languages, traditions, of different countries for history, culture and folklore.
